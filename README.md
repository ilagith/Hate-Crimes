## Hate Crimes
According to Pew Research (2020), America recorded an increase in immigration since 1960. 
As such, people from different cultures, religions, ethnicities interacted with each other.
They experienced differences in opinion and in their way of life (Budiman et al., 2020). 
On March 16th this year, Trump called coronavirus a “Chinese virus” and instances of hate crimes against people of Asian origin began to spike (Brito, 2020). This is an example of how hate crimes begin, how intense they could be, and how much impact these have. The curiosity for the hate crime dataset originated from the hate crimes recently committed against people of Asian origin.

### The Dataset
The chosen dataframe for this project is the Hate Crime Statistics dataset published by the FBI. It provides yearly statistics on the number of offenses committed, the number of incidents, offenders, and victims in crimes reported. The dataset, published on September 28, 2020, has 209443 rows and 28 columns containing hate crime records starting from 1991 till 2019. https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime

### Research Questions

1. Would a newly reported hate crime contain single or multiple victims? 
2. Would the newly reported hate crime consist of multiple offenses? (where multiple offenses mean; hate crime combined with other statutory crimes such as larceny, intimidation, robbery etc.)

### Methodology 
The process of data analysis is modeled by following the CRISP-DM model. First, the research questions were identified, followed by selecting the relevant and credible dataset (published by FBI, USA). Once cleaned the data, an exploratory data analysis was conducted. Hence, data were prepared for modeling and evaluation.  

### Conclusion
The models can accurately predict hate crimes with single victims in the US West region. If the model is fed with unseen data, it can accurately classify if the hate crime's victim is single.
In addition, the models can accurately predict hate crimes with single offenses better than hate crimes with multiple offenses in the West. If the model is fed with unseen data, it can accurately classify if the offense of the hate crime is single or multiple.
